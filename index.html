            <p class="main-paragraph">
              As Chelsea were clinching the league with a dominant win at Kingsmeadow, Barcelona’s players were crouching around a phone to watch Levante drop two points and confirm them as La Liga champions.
              “I understand how amazing Barcelona are, but so are we,” said Hayes. “It is a collaborative effort at Chelsea to get us where we are. We have cultivated something. We have a culture here to be the best – there is no complacency at the club.”
              Having won the title on the basis of points-per-game last year as the Covid-19 pandemic curtailed the season, Hayes was keen to emphasise how important it was to prove they could win the league without an asterisk attached. It shows they are “consistent as champions” she said.
              “In some people’s eyes we didn’t really win it, we were given it on a points-per-game scenario,” she said. “To say, actually, we are the champions, that’s a validation. 
              “I’m happy about that, because you don’t really want that hanging over you – the players really wanted to demonstrate that.” The 44-year-old pointed to the team’s single defeat, a 2-1 loss to Brighton, as a critical moment in the campaign and one that fuelled their title charge. 
              “The whole season, we’ve lost one game,” she said. “I’m glad we lost that game, we’re never too good to lose and I think it just keeps you on the edge of performance.”
              But before she devotes her time to preparing for the Barcelona challenge, Hayes said she was keen to get home to see her son Harry.
              “I woke up this morning feeling so bad at how little I’d seen my little boy, because of what I had to do here, and the last words he said to me when I walked out the door were: ‘Mummy, bring a medal home for me today, so that’s what I’m doing,” she said. (Guardian, 2021)

        <h2 class="who__heading">So who are Chelsea?</h2>
                            <i>Establishment</i>
              <p>Chelsea Ladies Football Club was formed in 1992 after supporters of Chelsea F.C. expressed desire for a women's side.[1] In June 2004, Chelsea Ladies voted to be taken over and funded by 
                 Chelsea's Football in the Community department.[2] The club then won promotion as champions from the Southern Division in 2004–05 to the Premier League National Division and have participated at the top level ever since.

                FA Premier League National Division, 2005–2010
                After starting 2005–06 with one point from six games, manager George Michealas was fired in September after four years in charge.[3] They finished bottom of the league that season under 
                Shaun Gore, but won a promotion/relegation play-off against Northern Division runners-up Liverpool 4–1 on aggregate to stay in the Premier League National Division.[4] During the season the 
                club had been linked with a transfer bid for North American star players Tiffeny Milbrett and Christine Sinclair.[5]

                After an eighth-placed finish in 2006–07, Gore drafted in England players Siobhan Chamberlain, Casey Stoney and Eniola Aluko that summer.[6] American World Cup winner Lorrie Fair, 
                regarded as one of the best midfielders in the women's game, joined in January as Chelsea finished 2007–08 in fifth position.[7] 
              </p>

              <p>Chelsea Ladies introduced a new manager for the 2008–09 season, former Arsenal Ladies reserve team coach Steve Jones. On 2 July 2008 Chelsea surprisingly signed Lianne Sanderson and 
                Anita Asante from Arsenal Ladies,[8] in addition to veteran Mary Phillip. Then Arsenal Ladies manager Vic Akers criticised his former players as disrespectful,[8] while pursuing players 
                from other clubs to bolster his own squad.

                Chelsea Ladies finished the 2008–09 season third behind Arsenal and Everton. Mary Phillip retired a month into the new season,[9] Eniola Aluko and Anita Asante left for the 
                new WPS in March 2009, while Lorrie Fair missed the whole campaign with a cruciate ligament injury sustained in May 2008.[10] Jones departed as manager in January 2009, leaving 
                Casey Stoney to act as player/manager.[11]
              </p>

              <p>At Casey Stoney's recommendation, Matt Beard became manager for 2009–10.[12] Cuts to the Ladies club's funding were offset by financial assistance from John Terry and other Chelsea 
                FC players.[12] A further blow arrived when Lianne Sanderson left for the 2010 WPS season.[13]

                FA Women's Super League (FA WSL), 2011–present
                The club bid successfully to be one of eight founding teams in the FA Women's Super League in March 2011.[14] Beard led the club to the Women's FA Cup final for the first time in 2012, 
                but Chelsea were eventually beaten by Birmingham City on a penalty shootout after twice taking the lead in a 2–2 draw.[15] In July 2012 Matt Beard resigned as manager after three years in the post,[16] to be replaced by Emma Hayes.

                In May 2013, Edda Garðarsdóttir revealed that club rules prevent Chelsea Ladies players from talking to their male clubmates, unless the male player initiates the conversation.[17]
              </p>

              <p>The 2014 season was successful for Chelsea, as they finished second in the FA Women's Super League behind Liverpool on goal difference, after eight wins, two draws and four losses. 
                 A final day win would have clinched them the league title, but they lost 2–1 away to Manchester City. Their second-place finish meant that they qualified for the UEFA Women's Champions League for the first time in the club's history. They also reached the semi finals of both the FA and Continental Cups, where they lost to both eventual winners, Arsenal and Manchester City respectively.

                In 2015, it was announced that many of Chelsea's players would be becoming full professionals for the first time.[18]

                On 1 August 2015, Chelsea won their first ever Women's FA Cup. They beat Notts County Ladies at Wembley Stadium. Ji So-yun scored the only goal at the 39th-minute while 
                Eniola Aluko won the player of the match award.[19] The team then beat Sunderland 4–0 in October 2015 to secure the FA WSL title and a League and Cup "double".[20] Chelsea repeated 
                that feat in the 2017–18 season, winning another FA WSL and Women's FA Cup double; in the same season, the team also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Women's Champions League for the first 
                time.[21] On 23 May 2018, the club rebranded as Chelsea Football Club Women.[22]
              </p>

              <p> Chelsea were awarded the 2019–20 WSL title on a points-per-game basis after the season had to be abruptly terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[23][24]

                Chelsea and manager Emma Hayes won their 4th WSL title, the most by any WSL team, by 2 points on the final day of the 2020–21 season with a 5–0 victory over Reading. Chelsea broke 
                the records for most wins (18) and most points (57) in a season, and became just the third team to defend the League title after Liverpool and Arsenal. Chelsea forward Sam Kerr won the WSL 
                Golden Boot for most goals scored by an individual (21), while her team-mate Fran Kirby was joint top for assists (11) and goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger registered the most clean sheets (12), 
                winning the Golden Glove.[23] Given their remarkable performances over the season and of a team filled with leaders, Suzzane Wrack of The Guardian stated that Chelsea was "best women's teams
                to ever play in England's top flight".[25](REF:WIKIPEDIA)
